Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to? (2 marks)

---Hospitals, in terms of reducing waiting times and inefficiencies. 

Next, you will play the role of the client and the data scientist.

Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer. (3 marks)

You are required to:

Describe the problem, related to the topic you selected.
Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data.
For example, using the food recipes use case discussed in the labs, the question that we defined was, "Can we automatically determine the cuisine of a given dish based on its ingredients?".


---Hospital have inefficiencies leading to morality, we would like to find these inefficencies to the current system to mortality rates.

---We like to see if there are any factors related with hospital staff, policies or standards to see if we can reduce unneeded deaths.

Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with. (5 marks):

Analytic Approach : 
---Diagnostic or descriptive models seems most relevant
---Classification models work too
  
Data Requirements
---Any data where a patient died after an initial visit to the hosipital in the last 6 months
---Patient deaths only in Ontario
---All ages and races

Data Collection
---Hospital records
---Clinic records
---Nursing homes

Data Understanding and Preparation
---Pairwise correlations to check if there was an increase in mortality and possible contributing factors
---Address missing / invalid values in rows of data


Modeling and Evaluation



You can always refer to the labs as a reference with describing how you would complete each stage for your problem.
