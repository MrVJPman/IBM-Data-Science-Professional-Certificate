Problem 1Â¶
How many Elementary Schools are in the dataset?
%sql select count(*) from SCHOOLS where "Elementary, Middle, or High School" = 'ES'

Problem 2
What is the highest Safety Score?
%sql select max(safety_score) from SCHOOLS 

Problem 3
Which schools have highest Safety Score?
%sql select NAME_OF_SCHOOL from SCHOOLS where safety_score = (select max(safety_score) from SCHOOLS )

Problem 4
What are the top 10 schools with the highest "Average Student Attendance"?
%sql select name_of_school, AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE from schools order by AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 10

Problem 5
Retrieve the list of 5 Schools with the lowest Average Student Attendance sorted in ascending order based on attendance
%sql select name_of_school, AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE from schools order by AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE ASC limit 5

Problem 6
Now remove the '%' sign from the above result set for Average Student Attendance column
%sql select name_of_school, REPLACE(AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE, '%', '') from schools order by AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE ASC limit 5

Problem 7
Which Schools have Average Student Attendance lower than 70%
%sql select name_of_school, AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE from schools where DECIMAL(REPLACE(AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE, '%', '')) < 70

Problem 8
Get the total College Enrollment for each Community Area
%sql select COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, sum(COLLEGE_ENROLLMENT) as TOTAL_ENROLLMENT from schools group by COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME

Problem 9
Get the 5 Community Areas with the least total College Enrollment sorted in ascending order
%sql select COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, sum(COLLEGE_ENROLLMENT) as TOTAL_ENROLLMENT from schools group by COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME ORDER BY TOTAL_ENROLLMENT ASC limit 5

Problem 10
Get the hardship index for the community area which has College Enrollment of 4638
%%sql 
select hardship_index 
   from chicago_socioeconomic_data 
   inner join schools 
   on chicago_socioeconomic_data.ca = schools.community_area_number 
   where college_enrollment = 4368

Problem 11
Get the hardship index for the community area which has the highest value for College Enrollment
%%sql select hardship_index , schools.COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, sum(schools.COLLEGE_ENROLLMENT) as total_enrollment
   from chicago_socioeconomic_data 
   inner join schools 
   on chicago_socioeconomic_data.ca = schools.community_area_number 
    group by hardship_index, schools.COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME
    order by total_enrollment DESC limit 1
	
#Solution from juptyer notebook. I believe this one doesn't factor in total enrollments
%sql select ca, community_area_name, hardship_index from chicago_socioeconomic_data \
where ca in \
( select community_area_number from schools order by college_enrollment desc limit 1 )

#My version for this lab
%%sql select hardship_index , schools.COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, schools.COLLEGE_ENROLLMENT
   from chicago_socioeconomic_data 
   inner join schools 
   on chicago_socioeconomic_data.ca = schools.community_area_number 
    order by schools.COLLEGE_ENROLLMENT DESC limit 1
